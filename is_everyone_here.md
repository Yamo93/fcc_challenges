# Is Everyone Here?

An object is created, users, with some users in it and a function isEveryoneHere, which we pass the users object to as an argument. Finish writing this function so that it returns true only if the users object contains all four names, Alan, Jeff, Sarah, and Ryan, as keys, and false otherwise.
