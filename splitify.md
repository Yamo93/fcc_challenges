# Functional Programming: Split a String into an Array Using the split Method

Since strings are immutable, the split method makes it easier to work with them.

***

Use the `split()` method inside the `splitify()` function to split `str` into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.
