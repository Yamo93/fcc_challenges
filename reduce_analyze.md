# Functional Programming: Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data

The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use reduce to find the average IMDB rating of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. Recall from prior challenges how to filter data and map over it to pull what you need. You may need to create other variables, but save the final average into the variable averageRating. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and need to be converted into numbers before they are used in any mathematical operations.
